The Digital Music Player is a custom digital device designed to play one of two classic tunes—the Pink Panther Theme song or Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Implemented on a Basys 3 FPGA board, this device uses a custom RISC‑V processor core developed in SystemVerilog, to execute machine‑code instructions that control memory‑mapped peripherals.
